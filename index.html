                        <p>Welcome to the homepage of Subansiri Women's Hostel. Subansiri Women's Hostel is named after
                            the river Subansiri, which is a major tributary of the Brahmaputra river. It originates from
                            Tibet, meandering through Arunachal Pradesh and Assam before flowing into the Bay of Bengal.
                            The name Subansiri means "River of Gold". This name now has become an integral part of each
                            of the boarder's identity. The things we learn here, the things we do, the memories we
                            gather from our stay here, are no less precious than gold. Subansiri Women's Hostel is not
                            just our home away from home, it's a part of our life, or we can even say, it's a way of our
                            life.</p>
